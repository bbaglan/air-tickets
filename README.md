Project's description: One of the least developed, but the most promising in the development of the economy is tourism in Kazakhstan. The amazing contrast of developed megacities and wild steppes makes Kazakhstan attractive even for the most sophisticated traveler, mainly in Kazakhstan there are various tours, trips with guides. And the number of platforms, websites, applications where you could find all the detailed information about where you can spend an ideal vacation with your family are rare.
